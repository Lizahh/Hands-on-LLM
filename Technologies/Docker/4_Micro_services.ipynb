        "\n",
        "## **1. Monolithic architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Puri app ek single big unit hoti hai (all features tightly packed together).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Tumhari ek e-commerce app jisme login, products, cart, payments → sab ek hi codebase me bundled.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Problem: Agar ek chhoti cheez break ho gayi (e.g. payment), poori app down ho sakti hai. Deployments bhi slow hote hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Microservices architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "* App ko tod kar chhote chhote independent services banayi jati hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Har service ka apna code, apna DB, apna deployment hota hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Login service (Team A)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Product catalog service (Team B)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Cart service (Team C)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Payment service (Team D)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ye sab ek doosre se APIs ke through baat karte hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🔹 Link with DevOps**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Microservices ke saath tum frequent small changes release kar sakte ho → DevOps ka “continuous delivery” goal achieve hota hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Har team apna microservice independently test, deploy aur scale kar sakti hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Isliye kehte hain → microservices DevOps ke liye perfect match hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Key Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Smaller release cycles → jaldi deploy kar sakte ho.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Immediate feedback → ek microservice update karke uski monitoring se pata chal jata hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Scalability → sirf us part ko scale karo jisme load zyada hai (e.g. Netflix pe video streaming service).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Resilience → ek service down ho gayi to poori app band nahi hogi.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Famous Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Amazon → har feature alag microservice hai (search, cart, checkout, recommendations).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Netflix → 1000+ microservices → har service independent teams handle karti hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Interview Line\n",
        "\n",
        "“Microservices is an architecture style where applications are divided into small, independent services that communicate over APIs. It enables faster deployments, smaller release cycles, and aligns perfectly with DevOps practices like CI/CD, monitoring, and automation. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use microservices to scale and innovate rapidly.”"

        "\n",
        "## **1. Scalability (Cost-Effective)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tum sirf wo service scale karti ho (barhati ho) jisme load zyada hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: E-commerce me “search” pe heavy traffic hai → sirf search service ko extra servers pe scale kar lo. Puri app scale karne ki zaroorat nahi.\n",
        "\n",
        "Result → cost bachi, resources optimized use huye.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Fault Isolation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Agar ek microservice fail ho jaye to baaki services chalti rehti hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Payment service crash ho gayi → users abhi bhi products browse aur cart me add kar sakte hain.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Monolith me hota ye tha ki payment crash = pura system crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. Localized Complexity**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Har team apne ek service ke complexity pe focus karti hai, pura monster application nahi.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Team A = login service, Team B = product service.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Developer fast onboard ho jata hai, productivity barh jati hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **4. Agility & Experimentation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Agility = fast + flexible hone ki ability. Matlab tum changes ko quickly adapt kar sako aur rapid response de sako. Market aur customer ki demand ke hisaab se quick adapt karna\n",
        "* Tum jaldi experiment kar sakti ho aur agar fail bhi hua to sirf ek service ko impact karega, pura system ko nahi.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Netflix ek naya recommendation algorithm ek microservice me test karta hai bina pura platform risk kiye.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **5. Easy Debugging & Maintenance**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Har microservice ka codebase chhota hota hai → debug karna aur maintain karna easy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Login me bug aaya → sirf login repo/service check karni hai, puri 10k lines ki monolith app me search nahi karna.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6. Business Alignment**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Har service ek business use case ke hisaab se design hoti hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Cart service = shopping cart business process → developers ko samajhna easy hota hai kyunki service customer’s viewpoint se aligned hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **7. Small, Agile Teams**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Microservices allow multiple small teams to work independently → speed barh jati hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Amazon me 2-pizza teams 🍕 (team itni chhoti ho ke 2 pizzas se khana khil jaye).\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🔹 Summary (Interview Line)**\n",
        "\n",
        "“Microservices provide cost-effective scalability, fault isolation, and localized complexity. They allow small agile teams to independently develop, deploy, and debug services aligned with business use cases. This increases agility, developer productivity, and resilience compared to monolithic systems.”"

        "\n",
        "1. Containerization: In a monolithic setup, the entire application is containerized as a single Docker container. This container encapsulates all the dependencies, libraries, and components required to run the application.\n",

Since the entire application runs within a single container, scaling requires replicating the entire application stack, including components that may not need to be scaled. This can lead to inefficient resource utilization.\n",
