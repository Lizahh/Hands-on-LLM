        "* Puri app ek single big unit hoti hai (all features tightly packed together).\n",

        "* Example: Tumhari ek e-commerce app jisme login, products, cart, payments ‚Üí sab ek hi codebase me bundled.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Problem: Agar ek chhoti cheez break ho gayi (e.g. payment), poori app down ho sakti hai. Deployments bhi slow hote hain.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Har team apna microservice independently test, deploy aur scale kar sakti hai.\n",

        "\n",
        "üîπ Key Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Smaller release cycles ‚Üí jaldi deploy kar sakte ho.\n",

        "  * Immediate feedback ‚Üí ek microservice update karke uski monitoring se pata chal jata hai.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Scalability ‚Üí sirf us part ko scale karo jisme load zyada hai (e.g. Netflix pe video streaming service).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Resilience ‚Üí ek service down ho gayi to poori app band nahi hogi.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîπ Famous Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Amazon ‚Üí har feature alag microservice hai (search, cart, checkout, recommendations).\n",

        "  * Netflix ‚Üí 1000+ microservices ‚Üí har service independent teams handle karti hain.\n",

        "‚ÄúMicroservices is an architecture style where applications are divided into small, independent services that communicate over APIs. It enables faster deployments, smaller release cycles, and aligns perfectly with DevOps practices like CI/CD, monitoring, and automation. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use microservices to scale and innovate rapidly.‚Äù"

        "* Tum sirf wo service scale karti ho (barhati ho) jisme load zyada hai.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Har microservice ka codebase chhota hota hai ‚Üí debug karna aur maintain karna easy.\n",

        "\n",
