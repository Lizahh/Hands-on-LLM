        "\n",
        "👉 Grant writing = Writing a formal request for funding from a government, NGO, foundation, or donor.\n",
        "It’s like saying:\n",
        "\n",
        "      “Here’s a problem that matters, here’s our project to solve it, and here’s why you should fund us.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Grants are competitive → many applicants, only strong proposals win.\n",

        "1. Cover Letter / Executive Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "    * A short intro (1 page).\n",
        "\n",
        "    * State who you are, what you want, how much money, and why.\n",

        "      * Answer: Why is this project important? Why now? Who will benefit?\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Use data, facts, case studies → funders want evidence.\n",
        "    \n",

        "\n",
        "✅ Be clear and persuasive → avoid jargon.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Show impact on people/community, not just tech.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Use numbers (quantify everything).\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Match the funder’s priorities → read their mission statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Keep it structured, easy to skim (funders read hundreds of proposals).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  * MS Word / Google Docs → Drafting.\n",

        "  * Overleaf (LaTeX) → Research-focused grants.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * GrantHub / Instrumentl → Track grant opportunities & submissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Grammarly / Hemingway → Clarity checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * ChatGPT (yes, like this 😅) → Draft sections, refine wording.\n",
